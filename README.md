This is the _Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope_ opening crawl [I built way back in 2009](http://tumblr.gesteves.com/post/261593774/im-done-star-wars-opening-crawl-using-only-html) using HTML & CSS3 animations. I don't know why I never bothered to put it in its own repo, but here it is. Here's a [detailed writeup about it in Ajaxian.com](http://ajaxian.com/archives/star-wars-html-and-css-a-new-hope).

Check it out in action at [starwars.gesteves.com](http://starwars.gesteves.com/).
